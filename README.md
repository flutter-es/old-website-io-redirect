An empty web site hosted by Firebase to perform redirects for the
old flutter.io domain.

There's no CI set up for this project; it's intended to be used
for only a few days while we set up DNS redirection for flutter.io.

You can deploy this using
```
firebase login
firebase deploy
```
Assuming that you have access permissions to the
`sweltering-fire-2088` Firebase project.
